		        <p>Hello,</p>
		        <p>My name is Zabrina. I am a new freelance web application developer. Working to build my own buisness and work for myself I am dedicated to building my portfolio and knowledge in the process. I have worked in customer service for the past 6 years and for the past 2 I have worked Tech Support for a dental software with a focus on Imaging. Basically what I have taken from my experience and plan to do with my own buisness is provide quality websites for individuals while working within the constrainsts of their budget and time constraints. Eventually I plan to grow my buisness to include helping with marketing and helping my clients with their online presence.</p>
		        <p>I promise to provide a quality website and open communication along the way. Help me build the website for your future while I build the portfolio for mine.</p>
